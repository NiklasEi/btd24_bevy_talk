# The open source game engine Bevy
*A talk for the [Big Techday] 2024*

**[slides]**

## The example project

During the talk I plan to develop a small 2d "game" to show how to put together a Bevy application using Plugins.


> If you don't have Rust set up, follow the [official instructions](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) to install the toolchain
> 
> Bevy might require some system dependencies. Please [check the docs](https://bevyengine.org/learn/quick-start/getting-started/setup/#installing-os-dependencies) if you run into issues.

Run the project with `cargo run`
